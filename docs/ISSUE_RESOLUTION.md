# Issue review and resolution (0.2.0)

## Host expansion follow-up (2026-10-07)

| Issue | Implemented evidence | Remaining boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#67](https://github.com/mj10612/SecureGateway/issues/67) | Versioned host/OS/auth/cost/scope table; shared Claude/Codex/xAI contract checks actual reads, bilingual aliases, schemas, split SSE, status codes, refreshed credentials and isolated encrypted state; offline suite runs in CI | Unverified hosts remain explicit candidates; live inference is opt-in |
| [#66](https://github.com/mj10612/SecureGateway/issues/66) | Separate API install/run/uninstall, fixed xAI origin, original settings/login preservation, token/state/auth isolation; actual Grok 1.0.46 English/Korean file-read and split SSE fixtures; API control leakage and model-collision regression coverage | Live paid API checks require separate opt-in; browser subscription reuse is unverified and unsupported |
| [#65](https://github.com/mj10612/SecureGateway/issues/65) | Actual Antigravity CLI 1.3.0 stdio config, conflict/preservation/space-path tests, initialize/list/tools handshake; SDK 0.1.21 actual bilingual file reads through a context-owned authenticated xAI bridge, masked provider payloads and restored tools/answers | Explicit xAI API billing only; IDE/CLI subscription redirection remains unverified |

## Original masking issue resolution

All 55 issues were reviewed against the code. Previously resolved #1–8 retain regression
coverage, adjusted where the safer 0.2 API deliberately changes representations or the MCP
trust boundary. The 47 remaining reports are covered by these changes and tests.

| Issues | Change | Evidence in tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #9, #11 | Sensitive code spans and URLs are atomic entities, including entities_only. | `test_sensitive_spans_mask_as_one_unit_and_restore` |

| #18 | Only a terminal possessive suffix is detached; apostrophes inside names are private. | `test_sensitive_spans_mask_as_one_unit_and_restore` |
| #19, #34, #51 | UUID/IP/phone spans are recognized before number/word splitting; classifier patterns share their definitions. | `test_sensitive_spans_mask_as_one_unit_and_restore` |
| #20, #25, #31, #38 | Language-specific literals/comments: backticks, raw delimiters, SQL escaping, multiline/nested strings and complete numeric forms. Malformed boundaries fail closed. | `test_language_literals_and_identifiers_do_not_leak`, `test_unterminated_literals_fail_closed`, `test_raw_braces_and_rust_lifetimes_are_supported` |
| #21 | Conservative Korean non-function-word masking in entities_only plus explicit sensitive terms. | Korean cases in `test_sensitive_spans_mask_as_one_unit_and_restore`, `test_bilingual_matrix` |
| #23, #36, #50 | Periodic idle cleanup; shared operation lock; purge waits and invalidates retained objects.

| #27 | Shared secret prefix/JWT and conservative long mixed-case token detection; explicit terms for unknown formats. | Credential cases in `test_sensitive_spans_mask_as_one_unit_and_restore` |
| #28 | Random 96-bit hash nonces independent of public salts and originals. | `test_hash_nonces_are_independent_of_original_and_public_salt` |
| #29, #33 | Single-syllable suffixes require stem evidence; bare/ambiguous nouns and names stay whole. | `test_ambiguous_korean_bare_nouns_are_not_truncated` |
| #30, #32 | Latin stems keep attached Korean particles; opt-in generated-response allomorph normalization. Exact roundtrips keep original particles. | `test_known_and_alphanumeric_korean_stems_keep_particles`, `test_generated_response_particle_normalization_is_explicit` |
| #35, #37, #41 | Language-specific keyword tables, missing core keywords, builtin/user-name masking, contextual Python keywords. | `test_core_keywords_preserved_per_language`, `test_language_literals_and_identifiers_do_not_leak`, `test_python_floor_division_and_contextual_keywords_preserve_syntax` |

| #40 | ASCII code names and literal contents; native numeric nonce constants. Review syntax is preserved while execution/types remain opaque. | `test_repository_python_code_is_parseable_after_masking`, `test_masked_python_numeric_patterns_compile`, `test_all_code_strategies_keep_python_bytes_and_literals_parseable`, `test_javascript_masked_source_passes_native_syntax_check` |
| #42 | Unicode punctuation and symbols, hyphens and Markdown structure preserved. | `test_punctuation_and_markdown_are_preserved` |

| #44, #46 | Type/context-aware mapping keys; sentence-initial proper-name candidates classified consistently. | `test_same_original_gets_distinct_type_and_context_allocations`, existing English entity regression tests |
| #52 | Versioned payloads, persisted allocations without regeneration, legacy read/update support, clear unsupported-version errors, exclusive CLI transaction lock. | `test_schema_version_and_generator_change_do_not_destroy_snapshots`, `test_legacy_pseudoword_snapshot_can_be_read_updated_and_read_again`, `test_cli_file_lock_covers_read_modify_write`, subprocess roundtrip tests |
| #53, #54 | Accurate metric aliases, unique vs occurrence counts, validated requested strategy, exposed preserve/sensitive options, removed unused fields/dead branch and duplicate suffix entries. | `test_metrics_distinguish_occurrences_and_unique_allocations`, `test_explicit_terms_and_preserve_are_available_in_cli_and_mcp`; lint/type checks |
| #55 | CI lint/type checks, warnings as errors, meaningful regression tests and an 85% coverage floor. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `pyproject.toml` |

Tests are in [test_issue_resolution.py](../tests/test_issue_resolution.py) and the existing suite.
The bilingual matrix exercises English, Korean, mixed input, four modes and four strategies.
No live provider was called: callbacks are mocked to verify the trust boundary and facts.

## Limits that remain intentional

This is a heuristic local masker, not universal NER or a full morphological/compiler frontend.
Unrecognized sensitive terms require explicit specification or broader masking. Korean unknown
ambiguous stems are preserved inside their masked whole word. Generated-response particle
correction is opt-in and does not guess foreign pronunciation. Arbitrary model deletions and
inventions cannot be reconstructed. Code output is for review, not execution or type checking.
Legacy bare pseudowords remain readable but retain their historic ambiguity; new sessions use
the safe format. Clearing references is not byte-level zeroization. These limits and migration
changes are documented in the English/Korean README rather than hidden behind absolute claims.

Unrelated sponsorship/marketing proposal content was removed. Generated caches and coverage
artifacts are excluded from the repository; the development environment remains available.


## October 2026 gateway follow-up

| Issues | Result | Regression evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #68 | Empty/whitespace streamed tool argument fragments preserved | test_gateway_followups |
| #69 | Per-provider state locks released across network waits; per-owner cached encryption derivation | test_gateway_runtime, test_snapshot_encryption |
| #70 | Public statuses/codes preserved with sanitized context compaction hints; buffering limits documented | test_gateway_runtime, test_upstream_context_errors |
| #71, #83 | Allocation bound configurable; authenticated idle-provider reset; crash-released OS locks | test_gateway_runtime, test_lock_recovery |
| #72 | Contextual source detection; duplicate traversal cleanup; live-test flags documented | test_gateway_source |
| #73 | Named JSON Schema dependencies share aliases; unsafe regex schemas rejected | test_gateway_followups |
| #74, #79 | Typed controls and request envelopes validated before transformation | test_gateway_validation, test_gateway_followups |
| #75, #76 | Retryable uninstall recovery journal and shared installation lock | test_install_recovery |
| #77, #88 | Truncated health/shutdown response recovery | test_install_validation, test_install_recovery |
| #80 | Contextual C/C++ directives preserved; header delimiters retained with private content masked | test_preprocessor |
| #81 | Explicit multiword sensitive terms keep attached Korean particles and exact restoration | test_sensitive_particles |
| #82 | Validated public query metadata forwarded; unsupported queries rejected | test_gateway_runtime, test_gateway_hosts |
| #84, #89 | Uninstalled operations and malformed manifests handled before mutation | test_install_validation |
| #86 | Lookahead design evaluated with measured baseline; buffering retained to preserve protocol/error contracts | docs/STREAMING.md, test_host_contract |
| #85 | Authenticated bounded xAI model catalog with normalized public fields | test_gateway_catalog |

C/C++ system and custom header **contents** are both masked; angle/quote delimiters and
preprocessor syntax remain intact. Masked source is for model review and is not guaranteed
to compile or resolve headers before restoration. Explicit sensitive-term suffix support
uses the accepted particle vocabulary, not arbitrary Korean substring splitting.


Local acceptance checks (Windows/Python 3.11.15): full warnings-as-errors suite,
coverage gate 85%, Ruff and mypy; optional native offline Claude/Codex/Grok scenarios
6 passed, actual Antigravity SDK 0.1.21 suite 15 passed/1 live skipped. Provider paid/live
calls were not enabled. GitHub cross-platform results are reported separately in issue
comments after pushing. The #86 design review retains buffering and includes measured
performance/memory evidence; it does not claim incremental streaming was implemented.
# Release 0.6.0 review follow-up

The following open issues were rechecked against the released code and addressed together.
Earlier release notes and parser fixtures remain historical records.

| Issues | Resolution and proof |
| --- | --- |
| #105, #107, #108, #128 | Public safety/tool-choice/context tags validated in their protocol positions; custom grammar envelopes pinned completely. `test_batch_gateway` |
| #106, #122, #123, #138–#142 | Language-specific C keywords, JS regex/templates, Python soft keywords/PEP 701, Go/SQL escapes, Rust lifetimes/nested comments. `test_batch_parser` |
| #109 | Already fixed with byte-based constant-time token comparison; non-ASCII regression remains covered by admin tests. |
| #110, #111, #113, #135, #137 | Strict Korean alias detection, relevant mapping lookup, request pinning, nonblocking cleanup, private numeric tails. `test_batch_core` |
| #112, #117, #120, #129–#134, #143–#145, #151, #152 | Safe shutdown/admission, aggregate diagnostics, upstream errors, schema/ref and streaming/numeric restoration. `test_batch_gateway`, `test_batch_interfaces` |
| #114, #124, #125 | Current SDK/lock documentation, compatible asyncio minimum, wheel/sdist CI smoke outside source. `scripts/package_smoke.py` |
| #115, #116, #118, #126, #146, #149 | UTF-8 CLI input, configurable resource budgets, safe snapshot retirement, bounded binary command capture, Windows hook paths. `test_batch_core`, `test_batch_hooks`, `test_batch_exec_capture`, `test_batch_interfaces` |
| #119, #153 | SDK retry/rate headers and anonymous credential filtering through API/UI. `test_batch_interfaces` |
| #121, #127, #136, #147, #148, #150 | Ownership checks, exact Orca synchronized hashes, redirect rejection, validated settings, durable install recovery, completed stop. `test_batch_install`, `test_batch_antigravity_install` |

Character literals (#130) use opaque identifier expressions rather than invalid multi-character
quoted placeholders. Masked code remains a review representation, not executable anonymization.
Unsupported string schema constraints fail before forwarding. Hook GC retires old host IDs rather
than reallocating their aliases, and persistent OS lock files are preserved.
